public class SnakeCaseStrategy implements NamingStrategy {

    /**
     * A {@link NamingStrategy} that translates typical camel case Java
     * property names to lower case JSON element names, separated by
     * underscores.  This implementation is somewhat lenient, in that it
     * provides some additional translations beyond strictly translating from
     * camel case only.  In particular, the following translations are applied
     * by this PropertyNamingStrategy.
     *
     * <ul><li>Every upper case letter in the Java property name is translated
     * into two characters, an underscore and the lower case equivalent of the
     * target character, with three exceptions.
     * <ol><li>For contiguous sequences of upper case letters, characters after
     * the first character are replaced only by their lower case equivalent,
     * and are not preceded by an underscore.
     * <ul><li>This provides for reasonable translations of upper case acronyms,
     * e.g., &quot;theWWW&quot; is translated to &quot;the_www&quot;.</li></ul></li>
     * <li>An upper case character in the first position of the Java property
     * name is not preceded by an underscore character, and is translated only
     * to its lower case equivalent.
     * <ul><li>For example, &quot;Results&quot; is translated to &quot;results&quot;,
     * and not to &quot;_results&quot;.</li></ul></li>
     * <li>An upper case character in the Java property name that is already
     * preceded by an underscore character is translated only to its lower case
     * equivalent, and is not preceded by an additional underscore.
     * <ul><li>For example, &quot;user_Name&quot; is translated to
     * &quot;user_name&quot;, and not to &quot;user__name&quot; (with two
     * underscore characters).</li></ul></li></ol></li>
     * <li>If the Java property name starts with an underscore, then that
     * underscore is not included in the translated name, unless the Java
     * property name is just one character in length, i.e., it is the
     * underscore character.  This applies only to the first character of the
     * Java property name.</li></ul>
     *<p>
     * These rules result in the following additional example translations from
     * Java property names to JSON element names.
     * <ul><li>&quot;userName&quot; is translated to &quot;user_name&quot;</li>
     * <li>&quot;UserName&quot; is translated to &quot;user_name&quot;</li>
     * <li>&quot;USER_NAME&quot; is translated to &quot;user_name&quot;</li>
     * <li>&quot;user_name&quot; is translated to &quot;user_name&quot; (unchanged)</li>
     * <li>&quot;user&quot; is translated to &quot;user&quot; (unchanged)</li>
     * <li>&quot;User&quot; is translated to &quot;user&quot;</li>
     * <li>&quot;USER&quot; is translated to &quot;user&quot;</li>
     * <li>&quot;_user&quot; is translated to &quot;user&quot;</li>
     * <li>&quot;_User&quot; is translated to &quot;user&quot;</li>
     * <li>&quot;__user&quot; is translated to &quot;_user&quot;
     * (the first of two underscores was removed)</li>
     * <li>&quot;user__name&quot; is translated to &quot;user__name&quot;
     * (unchanged, with two underscores)</li></ul>
